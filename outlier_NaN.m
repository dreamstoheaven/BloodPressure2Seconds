function [ cleansignal_s, cleansignal_m, cleansignal_d, T_cleansignal_s,T_cleansignal_m,T_cleansignal_d pulse_pressure ] = outlier_NaN( signal_s, signal_m, signal_d, T_signal_s, T_signal_d,T_signal_m )

% This is the function which actually removes outliers/filters the dataset.
% The criteria defaulted to (and was used in all figures we generated) is
% that if the difference between S_BP, M_BP and D_BP is smaller than a
% value, or if any of the signals are negative, then all three signals of that time are
% removed. Datapoints directly next to the removed point are also removed. For example, if 
% time i is removed, time i-1 and time i+1 will also be removed if they are
% in the dataset. The removal proccess is dome in two steps to avoid
% dynamic indexing. The first step involves assining a value to all points
% that need to be removed (flagging all bad datapoints), and the second
% step is to actually remove the datapoints. Any negative number can serve
% as the flag.
